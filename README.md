# Contributing

The NostrGit project operates an open contributor model where anyone is welcome to contribute towards development in the form of peer review, documentation, testing and patches. Anyone is invited to contribute without regard to technical experience, "expertise", OSS experience, age, or other concern.

If you are new to contributing to open source projects, please see the [Open Source Guides](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/) on how to get started.

See [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/NostrGit/NostrGit/blob/main/documentation/development/contributing.md).

You may also want to check out the [bitcoin-development](https://github.com/jonatack/bitcoin-development/blob/master/how-to-review-bitcoin-core-prs.md) repository about the principles of Bitcoin development in general. Most of them apply also here.
